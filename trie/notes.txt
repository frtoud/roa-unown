- optimized animation storage (less files the better)
- Word list upgrade
    //check if loading trie ingame is possible
    // not optimal. file loads fast, trie takes 2 minutes to build
    //allow loading across multiple frames?

STEAM DESCRIPTION

E S C A P E

[summary] https://ibb.co/VJ3SR6q

Shaped like ancient text characters, it is a mystery as to which came first, the ancient writings or the various Unown.

Unown's special ability is LEVITATE! Unowns rarely, if ever, touch the ground. Use this strange mobility to your advantage!

Unown's signature move is HIDDEN POWER, a unique attack that varies in type and intensity depending on the individual Pokémon. Try out each letter's special variation!

A lone Unown alone is weak, but an odd power emerges when there are many. Chain moves in a specific order to create words, and boost the power of your attacks!


If you need help on how to use Unown's moveset, please check out the [enclosed instruction book].
