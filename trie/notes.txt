Shaped like ancient text characters, it is a mystery as to which came first, the ancient writings or the various Unown.

Unown's special ability is LEVITATE! Unowns rarely, if ever, touch the ground. Use this strange mobility to your advantage!

Unown's signature move is HIDDEN POWER, a unique attack that varies in type and intensity depending on the individual Pokémon. Try out each letter's special variation!

A lone Unown alone is weak, but an odd power emerges when there are many. Chain moves in a specific order to create words, and boost the power of your attacks!


If you need help on how to use Unown's moveset, please check out the [enclosed instruction book].

Special Thanks

Special Unthanks
- Unown's Attack stat

//check if loading trie ingame is possible
// not optimal. file loads fast, trie takes 2 minutes to build


Unown v1.1 (& vJ.1)
Gameplay Changes:
* Added 2-frame "diagonal leniency": a move in a cardinal direction can transition into its diagonal neighbors during this time
* Word List:
. - Removed a handful of words to lower ESRB rating
. - Added a handful of words related to Rivals and the Workshop
. - Added a handful of Pokémon-related terms
. - Unown now collects the name of other characters into its dictionary on match start

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed J (attack index 10, AT_DATTACK) stumbling into some odd Dan-esque behavior that reset HSP to zero on use
