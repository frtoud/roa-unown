TODO:
- keyboard mode
- Runes?
- more word effects- pokedex munophone ("Unown report")
- pseudocrouch/pseudodash
- extra portraits
- Attack reworks (VFX, refined animations, more typings)
- more animations (Tumble, bighurt, idle animations)
- optimized animation storage (less files the better)
- Word list upgrade
    //check if loading trie ingame is possible
    // not optimal. file loads fast, trie takes 2 minutes to build
    //allow loading across multiple frames?

STEAM DESCRIPTION

E S C A P E

[summary] https://ibb.co/VJ3SR6q

Shaped like ancient text characters, it is a mystery as to which came first, the ancient writings or the various Unown.

Unown's special ability is LEVITATE! Unowns rarely, if ever, touch the ground. Use this strange mobility to your advantage!

Unown's signature move is HIDDEN POWER, a unique attack that varies in type and intensity depending on the individual Pokémon. Try out each letter's special variation!

A lone Unown alone is weak, but an odd power emerges when there are many. Chain moves in a specific order to create words, and boost the power of your attacks!


If you need help on how to use Unown's moveset, please check out the [enclosed instruction book].

//========================================================================================
feedback

LOSER is a combo
BOOKKEEPER+X is OP
 - running away and spelling words is too easy

 - vertical stalling needs to be toned down. massively. (G/doublejumps)
 - levitate needs to be toned down. too hard toc ombo/get comboed

 - check tapjump protection
 - 
//fixed:
 - A needs stalling prevention
 - E needs higher angle
 - G needs a nerf. goes too high too quickly. speed cap? and ceiling bonk
 - N needs a nerf. add cap to counter kb? reduce multiplier? shorter duration
 - X needs a nerf. turn into horzflipper-E ? kinda too fast rn too. could be made light.
 - Y fastfall at the end

//fix:
 - lock movement when in pratland
 - J needs a buff. too easy to get the smooth melee grab sfx and not grab. armor? disjoint?
 - Y needs... something. a bit too lackluster given G and T. 

 //bonus:
 - C could get downwards-angled variant
 - V needs a use.
 - Y could get upwards-shooting variant
 - add unown radio noise to victory music
